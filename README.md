<h1>Crime Data Analysis and Visualization</h1>

<p>This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing crime data to gain insights into crime patterns and trends. By using data such as crime reports, locations, dates, and times, the project explores different aspects of criminal activity and presents visualizations to help understand the data better.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Data preprocessing and cleaning for crime records.</li>
  <li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover crime trends and patterns.</li>
  <li>Visualizations of crime data using <strong>Matplotlib</strong> and <strong>Seaborn</strong>.</li>
  <li>Crime frequency analysis based on time of occurrence, location, and type of crime.</li>
  <li>Detailed insights into specific areas with high crime rates.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dataset</h2>

<p>The project uses a crime dataset containing the following key columns:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>DR_NO</strong>: Crime report number.</li>
  <li><strong>Date Rptd</strong>: Date the crime was reported.</li>
  <li><strong>DATE OCC</strong>: Date the crime occurred.</li>
  <li><strong>TIME OCC</strong>: Time the crime occurred.</li>
  <li><strong>AREA</strong>: Area code where the crime occurred.</li>
  <li><strong>AREA NAME</strong>: Name of the area where the crime occurred.</li>
  <li><strong>Crm Cd</strong>: Code representing the type of crime.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>pandas</code></li>
  <li><code>matplotlib</code></li>
  <li><code>seaborn</code></li>
  <li><code>numpy</code> (optional, for advanced data manipulation)</li>
</ul>

<p>Install the dependencies using:</p>

<pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>The project explores the following aspects of crime data:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Crime Trends</strong>: Visualizing crime occurrence over time (daily, monthly, or yearly trends).</li>
  <li><strong>Geographical Analysis</strong>: Mapping crime hotspots and identifying areas with high crime rates.</li>
  <li><strong>Time Analysis</strong>: Identifying peak times for criminal activities (time of day, weekdays, etc.).</li>
  <li><strong>Crime Types</strong>: Analyzing the distribution of different types of crimes (e.g., theft, assault, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>The project presents visualizations that help understand crime patterns, including bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps. These visualizations offer insights into crime frequencies, locations, and the types of crimes that are most prevalent in specific areas.</p>

<h2>Customization</h2>

<p>You can adjust the following aspects of the project:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Dataset</strong>: Use a different crime dataset or add more variables for deeper analysis.</li>
  <li><strong>Visualizations</strong>: Create additional visualizations, such as pie charts or maps, to gain more insights into the data.</li>
  <li><strong>Time Analysis</strong>: Perform advanced time series analysis to forecast future crime trends.</li>
</ul>
